## What is a raycaster?
A raycaster is a 2D game but it draw something called "rays" on the 2d map, and then calculates the size of each line and the brightness from a first person distance, making it a 3D game. This is a common tactic used in old games like Wolfenstein 3D (Doom is not a raycaster, btw)
